# Day 1: Inverse Captcha

The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. "The printer's broken! We can't print the **Naughty or Nice List**!" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. "We have a big problem," she says; "there must be almost **fifty** bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in ***stars***, you'll be able to--" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.

When your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than before. She must have sent you inside the computer! You check the system clock: **25 milliseconds** until midnight. With that much time, you should be able to collect all ***fifty stars*** by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each ~~day~~ millisecond in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants ***one star***. Good luck!

You're standing in a room with "digitization quarantine" written in LEDs along one wall. The only door is locked, but it includes a small interface. "Restricted Area - Strictly No Digitized Users Allowed."

It goes on to explain that you may only leave by solving a [captcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) to prove you're **not** a human. Apparently, you only get one millisecond to solve the captcha: too fast for a normal human, but it feels like hours to you.

The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input) and find the **sum** of all digits that match the **next** digit in the list. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the **first** digit in the list.

For example:

- `1122` produces a sum of `3` (`1` + `2`) because the first digit (`1`) matches the second digit and the third digit (`2`) matches the fourth digit.
- `1111` produces `4` because each digit (all `1`) matches the next.
- `1234` produces `0` because no digit matches the next.
- `91212129` produces `9` because the only digit that matches the next one is the last digit, `9`.

## Part Two

You notice a progress bar that jumps to 50% completion. Apparently, the door isn't yet satisfied, but it did emit a ***star*** as encouragement. The instructions change:

Now, instead of considering the **next** digit, it wants you to consider the digit **halfway around** the circular list. That is, if your list contains 10 items, only include a digit in your sum if the digit `10/2 = 5` steps forward matches it. Fortunately, your list has an even number of elements.

For example:

- `1212` produces `6`: the list contains `4` items, and all four digits match the digit `2` items ahead.
- `1221` produces `0`, because every comparison is between a `1` and a `2`.
- `123425` produces `4`, because both `2`s match each other, but no other digit has a match.
- `123123` produces `12`.
- `12131415` produces `4`.

## Part Two

"Great work; looks like we're on the right track after all. Here's a ***star*** for your effort." However, the program seems a little worried. Can programs **be** worried?

"Based on what we're seeing, it looks like all the User wanted is some information about the **evenly divisible values** in the spreadsheet. Unfortunately, none of us are equipped for that kind of calculation - most of us specialize in bitwise operations."

It sounds like the goal is to find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the other - that is, where the result of the division operation is a whole number. They would like you to find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line's result.

For example, given the following spreadsheet:

```
5 9 2 8
9 4 7 3
3 8 6 5
```

- In the first row, the only two numbers that evenly divide are `8` and `2`; the result of this division is `4`.
- In the second row, the two numbers are `9` and `3`; the result is `3`.
- In the third row, the result is `2`.

In this example, the sum of the results would be `4 + 3 + 2 = 9`.

What is the **sum of each row's result** in your puzzle input?

## Part Two

As a stress test on the system, the programs here clear the grid and then store the value `1` in square `1`. Then, in the same allocation order as shown above, they store the sum of the values in all adjacent squares, including diagonals.

So, the first few squares' values are chosen as follows:

- Square `1` starts with the value `1`.
- Square `2` has only one adjacent filled square (with value `1`), so it also stores `1`.
- Square `3` has both of the above squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, `2`.
- Square `4` has all three of the aforementioned squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, `4`.
- Square `5` only has the first and fourth squares as neighbors, so it gets the value `5`.

Once a square is written, its value does not change. Therefore, the first few squares would receive the following values:

```
147  142  133  122   59
304    5    4    2   57
330   10    1    1   54
351   11   23   25   26
362  747  806--->   ...
```

What is the **first value written** that is **larger** than your puzzle input?
